# Academic Paper Search Engine

## Overview
Developed an Academic Paper Search Engine to improve the accuracy and relevance of academic paper retrieval using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project allows users to search for academic papers using semantic search and enhanced query matching, making it easier to find relevant research articles. This project was completed during Year 3, Semester 1, for the **Information Retrieval and Web Analytics** module, with me serving as the team leader of a four-member group.

## Key Features
- **Entity Recognition:** Implemented Named Entity Recognition (NER) to better understand key terms in user queries and academic paper content.
- **Query Expansion:** Expanded user queries with relevant terms to retrieve broader yet relevant results.
- **Semantic Search:** Used a BERT-based model for semantic similarity matching to find papers that are contextually aligned with user queries.
- **Feedback Logging:** Integrated Google Sheets to log user feedback and track relevance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score based on feedback.
- **Web Framework:** Developed the user interface using Streamlit for easy interaction and deployment.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python (for backend, data processing, and NLP tasks)
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Keras, TensorFlow, NLTK, SpaCy, Flask, Streamlit
- **Machine Learning:** BERT, Query Expansion, TF-IDF, Scikit-learn for model evaluation
- **Data Management:** Google Sheets API for feedback storage and metric calculations
- **Deployment:** Streamlit
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub for project collaboration and version tracking
- **Cloud Services:** Google Drive for dataset storage

## Installation
